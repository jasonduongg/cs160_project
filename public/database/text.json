      "content": "This afternoon at the café, I somehow managed to knock over an entire tray of drinks—mine and two other customers'—just by trying to squeeze past a chair. The crash was so loud that everyone turned to stare, and in my panic, I made it worse by trying to apologize while frantically picking up ice cubes off the floor with my bare hands. The barista was nice about it, but I couldn’t shake the hot, prickly feeling of humiliation for the rest of the day. Looking back, I realize it wasn’t that big of a deal (accidents happen), but in the moment it felt like I had singlehandedly ruined the entire vibe of the café. I keep wondering why even small mistakes can feel so overwhelmingly huge when you're caught in them.",
